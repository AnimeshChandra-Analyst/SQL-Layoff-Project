Company Layoffs Data Analysis Project
Project Overview:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of company layoffs data, focusing on two primary phases:

  -Data Cleaning: Preparing the dataset for accurate analysis by removing inconsistencies and ensuring uniformity.
  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the cleaned data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to company layoffs.

Problem Statement:
The primary objective is to analyze global layoff trends from 2020 to 2023 to understand:

  -Which industries and countries experienced the highest number of layoffs.
  -Temporal patterns in layoffs, identifying peak periods.
  -Company-specific layoff trends and their correlation with factors like funding stages.
  
Methodology:

Data Cleaning:
The data cleaning process involved several steps:

  1)Removing Duplicates: Identified and eliminated duplicate records to ensure each entry was unique.
  2)Standardizing Data: Normalized textual data by trimming whitespace and consolidating similar categories (e.g., unifying various representations of 'Crypto' under a single label).
  3)Handling Null or Blank Values: Addressed missing data by either imputing values based on related records or removing incomplete entries.
  4)Formatting Dates: Converted date fields from text to standardized date formats to facilitate temporal analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Post-cleaning, the analysis focused on extracting meaningful insights:

  1)Industry Impact Assessment: Calculated total layoffs per industry to identify sectors most affected.
  2)Geographical Distribution: Summarized layoffs by country to determine regional impacts.
  3)Temporal Trends: Analyzed layoffs over time to spot trends, including monthly and yearly breakdowns.
  4)Company-Specific Analysis: Identified companies with the highest layoffs and examined their characteristics, such as funding stages.


Key Findings:

  -Industry Impact: The analysis revealed that certain industries, such as Consumer, Retail, Transportation, Finance, and Healthcare, experienced higher layoffs during the analyzed period.
  -Geographical Distribution: Countries like the United States, India, and the Netherlands reported the most significant number of layoffs.
  -Temporal Trends: There were observable peaks in layoffs corresponding to global events, suggesting external factors influencing employment trends.
  -Company-Specific Trends: Some companies underwent complete shutdowns, while others had substantial layoffs despite significant funds raised, indicating potential financial mismanagement or market shifts.


Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, it's evident that unexpected global events can significantly impact employment across various sectors. To mitigate such effects, companies should implement robust financial planning and conduct regular risk assessments. Policymakers are encouraged to develop support systems tailored for industries and regions disproportionately affected by layoffs, promoting economic stability. Future research could explore the relationship between a company's funding stage and its likelihood of implementing layoffs, providing startups with insights for better financial management.
